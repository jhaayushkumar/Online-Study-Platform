⚠️  IMPORTANT: Gmail App Password Required! ⚠️

Your backend is configured to use Gmail SMTP, but you need to add your Gmail App Password.

📝 QUICK STEPS:

1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

2. Generate an App Password for "Mail"

3. Copy the 16-character password (remove spaces)

4. Open: backend/.env

5. Replace this line:
   MAIL_PASS=your_gmail_app_password_here

   With:
   MAIL_PASS=your_actual_16_character_password

6. Save the file (backend will auto-restart)

7. Test: cd backend && node test-email.js

📖 Detailed instructions: See GMAIL_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md

✅ After this, OTP emails will work perfectly!
